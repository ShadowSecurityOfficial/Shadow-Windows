# How to use?

Boot into ISO and install, after install connect to the internet and use snappy driver installer to install drivers (if you are on a virtual machine you should install the virtual machine drivers). After this, click the script on the desktop inside the Shadow folder that you want to turn the machine into, currently you have two options:

Commando (Offensive Security) Or Flare (Cyber Forensics)

Run the powershell script you chose accordingly, reboot after it is done, and you are all set to work inside windows. (If you get any errors when running the script rerun the script and it will retry, and try to automatically fix the errors, the most common issue is network problems.)
